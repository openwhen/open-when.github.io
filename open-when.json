You make me feel like I can be whoever I want and do whatever I want to do. Like in the song 'Somebody to Someone' you are not only my someone, my everything now. Your smell, every look, every touch, every word give me butterflies. You are the first thing I think about when I wake up and last thing I think about when i fall asleep since the first day we met and I have no intention for it to change."
