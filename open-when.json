Please open the letters when applies and open at most 2 letters a day and let me know everytime you open one. I hope you'll enjoy every single one of them."

You make me feel like I can be whoever I want and do whatever I want to do. Like in the song 'Somebody to Someone' you are not only my someone, my everything now. Your smell, every look, every touch, every word give me butterflies. You are the first thing I think about when I wake up and last thing I think about when i fall asleep since the first day we met and I have no intention for it to change."

		"message": "I want you to know that especially when we sleep in a call, I feel the warmth and it just puts me to sleep. Tone of your voice, your beautiful eyes, the way you get into comfortable position on your chair, how you talk in your sleep, how you laugh, how you make fun of me, how you call me and ask me stuff, how you put dots like this........ They all just make me smile and I'm not afraid to tell you, you are my other half. You have no idea how much I want to heal your wounds listening to you with hugs and kisses. How much I want to take some weight out of your chest and help you enjoy life. This is something else dude I'm not familiar with the feelings I have for you. I'll do better for you so you can do even better. I love how clear and open to me and how it made me love you even more."

		"message": "For this one I'll just copy paste a message I sent on July. My thoughts and feeling on how amazing you are, just got more and more intense every single day I spent on you. Message: Baby I don't think I can ever express my feelings to you. I also don't understand how little people appreciate you. I know you don't care but I do. When I think of you I think I hope one day I can be like him. Thinking of what you've been through I just can't believe how much you achieved. I don't know if I have the right to be proud of you because I wasn't there when you graduated college, get your first job and when you moved out. But now you work for hours, take care of yourself, Yoshi, a whole house (which is mindblowing to me). And sadly you mostly take care of them by yourself, about 99% of time. Baby you don't understand how much you achieved. Just an example, you corrected your sleep schedule, you struggled but you still did it. You are so rare and you don't even know. You are so brave and you being that way encourages me to be more. Not only doing good on your life you also help me doing better in my life. And I think you are the one who should be proud of yourself, not me. I am but still you need to see how much you achieved and you are only 24. I want to be with you in every success and fail of yours. And no matter how many times you'll fail I'll still be proud of you. Even now when I talk about you I mention you work in UPS ahahahah that makes me proud tbh. My boyfriend works in one of the biggest companies in the world. And fyi everyone get impressed. You also should know that I'm still not over how you dared to move out at 22. You are doing amazing, when you live alone everything is harder and you nail all of them. Please see how much you achieve and be proud of yourself. If you don't want to do it for yourself do it for me because I need you to understand how precious and rare you are."

Here are some things you need to know: Kitchen will constantly smell coffee but I'll always make some for you too, I might stay in the bathroom more than 3 minutes sorry in advance, I constantly sing if you aren't hearing it I am probably singing internally and giggling, I am a bad cook but eager to learn to be better at it, I want to grow fruits and vegetables so I'd love it if you spare some place for it in the garden, I also tuck in every possible shirt - fair warning. I am very easy-going plus you are a really handsome so I'd like to share beds and just for you I have sex service, ENJOY! "

Maybe you are sick because you work too hard or you don't want to use the heater too much or maybe stress got you sick. Whatever the reason please lie down and get as much as sleep as I can. Good news is this sickness gave you a coupon of 'Taken Care of Yaren for 1 Day' you can use in the future. I love you so much please get well soon."
